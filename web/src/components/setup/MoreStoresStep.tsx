          The EA app, Ubisoft Connect, Battle.net and Xbox (Game Pass too) have no sign-in UpNext can use, so their libraries
          can't be read.
          GOG Galaxy reads them where it's linked to them; otherwise list your games from them by hand, and they're picked like
          any others.
