//! Runtime configuration. Every setting is one row in [`SETTINGS`]: its key,
//! the environment variable (or `.env` line) that sets it, its default,
//! whether the app can change it (stored in the database, where it wins over
//! the environment), whether it is secret, and the `Config` field it fills.
//! Loading, the in-app overlay, validation, `config list` and the export all
//! walk that table. The table and the lookups that walk it are in
//! `settings`, the checks for a value typed in the app in `check`, loading
//! and the overlay in `load`, the `public_url` setting and local addresses
//! in `address`, and finding the AI CLIs in `programs`.
//!
//! Paths follow the platform's per-user folders ([`Dirs`]): on Linux the
//! database and backups live in `~/.local/share/upnext`, `.env` is
//! read from `~/.config/upnext`, and `~/.cache/upnext` is the AI CLI's
//! working directory. An installed UpNext works the same from any folder.
