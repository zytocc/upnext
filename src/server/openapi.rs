const DESCRIPTION: &str = "The HTTP API of UpNext, the game library that picks what to play next. \
This is the v1 contract: adding a field or an endpoint is fine within v1; removing or renaming one means v2. \
Paths are relative to `/api/v1`; `/api/...` answers the same until the first public release.\n\n\
This computer (a loopback address, addressed as localhost) needs no token. Another device needs a token \
(`Authorization: Bearer upnext_…`, scope `read` or `full`) or a paired browser's cookie (`upnext_device`, full). \
Each operation's `security` says which; an operation marked `x-local-only` answers only on the computer UpNext runs on.\n\n\
An operation with the `UpNext-Player` parameter answers for one player: a token bound to a player, else that header, \
else the browser's player cookie, else the default player.\n\n\
Errors are `{\"error\": \"…\"}` with the status.";
