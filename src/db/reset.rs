//! What "Restart the setup wizard" can clear before the wizard starts:
//! sign-ins and keys, the AI choice, the taste profile, statuses and history,
//! or the whole library. `server::setup` takes a backup first.
//!
//! Every table is named in exactly one of the lists below, so a new table
//! has to say which part it belongs to (`every_table_has_a_part`).
//!
//! With two or more players, the taste profile and the history are
//! the asking player's own: only their rows go, and the others keep theirs.
//! The whole library is everyone's, so it still takes every player's.
