//! Discovery: ways to find something you wouldn't have picked
//! yourself, from your own library. **New to you** picks easy, short games
//! in genres or mechanics you've never played (`new_to_you`); **Hidden
//! gems** are unplayed, highly rated, short games the AI rated as unusual
//! (`gems`). Each is a pick mode: "New to me" or "A hidden gem" in a
//! request, or `mode` on `POST /api/picks`, narrows the candidates to its
//! games and gives the AI its rule. A third mode, **Roll the dice**
//! (`random`), narrows them to games off your radar and draws one at
//! random, with no AI; only `mode` asks for it.
