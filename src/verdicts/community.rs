//! Everyone's backlog verdicts about a game, as an install reads them from
//! the snapshot (`docs/verdicts/snapshot.md`).
//!
//! A game's published counts become, without an AI call:
//! - [`Backlog`], what a game carries through the library: the headline
//!   from `worth`, the "most players" lines, and the facets picks and the
//!   library's filters read. Only answers with a clear majority (at least
//!   half of the game's verdicts, and at least [`PERCENT_AT`] of them) say
//!   anything about what the game is like.
//! - [`GameVerdicts`], the game page's section: the same, how far people
//!   got with the typical hours of each outcome, and the newest texts.
//! - The prompt's `bv` line, the pick card's line and Second Chance's line.
//!
//! The words come from the vocabulary's own tables (`vocab.rs`), so the
//! form and the game page say the same thing.
