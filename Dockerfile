# UpNext's container image: the server and its web UI, without the
# desktop window (no GTK or WebKitGTK). contrib/docker/compose.yaml runs it;
# docs/install/docker.md has the steps. Build: `docker build -t upnext .`, or for
# both architectures `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .`
#
# Every build stage runs on the builder's own platform: the web UI is the
# same for both, and the server is cross-compiled for the other one. The
# image itself runs nothing while it's built, so an arm64 image builds on an
# amd64 machine at full speed, without QEMU.
#
# Each base image is pinned to a digest beside its tag, so a tag that moves
# upstream can't change what's built; Dependabot (.github/dependabot.yml)
# proposes the new digest when the tag moves. Debian is named by release
# (trixie, like the build stages) rather than `stable`, which would jump to
# the next release on its own.

# 1. The web UI.
