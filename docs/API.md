# UpNext HTTP API (v1)

The UpNext server answers on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` unless set otherwise. The UI uses this API, and so can scripts and other apps.

- **Versions.** The contract is `/api/v1/…`. Adding a field or an endpoint stays within v1; removing or renaming one would mean v2. Unversioned `/api/…` paths answer the same as an alias outside the contract; these pages write paths that way for short, but scripts should use `/api/v1/…`.
- **The precise contract** is the OpenAPI document at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`, made from the code and kept as [`docs/openapi.json`](openapi.json). These pages are the readable guide.
- **Bodies** are JSON. Times are Unix seconds and playtime is minutes unless a field says otherwise. Errors are `{"error": "…"}` with a plain reason, even for a path, query or body the server can't read. A `500` gives the real reason only on the computer UpNext runs on; any other device reads "Something went wrong on the server. UpNext's log on the computer it runs on says what."
- **Who it acts for.** Most routes answer for one player: the token's, the `UpNext-Player` header's, the browser's choice, or the default ([Players](api/players.md)).
