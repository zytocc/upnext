# Series

`GameView.series` lists the series a title belongs to, from Wikidata and PCGamingWiki. `GameView.first_year` is the original release year from Wikidata, or null.

Two enrich sources fill them in: `series` (on by default) and `series_guides` (off by default; uses the AI with the picks' `model`), which writes a guide for each series with two or more owned games.

## GET /api/collections

Every series with at least two games, owned or not (not-games left out), started series first, then larger ones:

```json
[{
  "key": "witcher",
  "name": "The Witcher",
  "members": ["GameView", "..."],
  "years": {"412": 2007, "413": 2011},
  "played": 2,
  "start_id": 412,
  "next_id": 412,
  "guide": {"start_id": 412, "order": [412, 413, 414], "side": [{"id": 500, "kind": "spin-off"}],
            "note": "Start with Witcher 1 ...", "model": "<model>", "generated_at": 1790575000},
  "guide_stale": false,
  "missing": [{"qid": "Q…", "name": "…", "year": 2015, "steam_appid": 292030, "cover": "https://…"}],
  "subseries": [{"name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops", "ids": [101, 102]}]
}]
```

- `members` are in play order when there's a guide (main line first, then side entries), else oldest first.
- `played` counts the members that aren't untouched or sampled.
- `start_id` is where to begin (the guide's, else the first in order). `next_id` is the next unplayed main-line game, or the start when that's unplayed.
- `guide` is null until one is written. It names the game to start with, the main-line order, and the owned entries outside it with their kind (`spin-off`, `remaster`, `duplicate`, `expansion`, `multiplayer`, `tool` or `other`), plus a short note. It is written again only when the owned games change, which `guide_stale` flags.
- `missing` are the series' games you don't own, oldest first: PC releases only. `igdb_slug`, `gog_id` and `gog_slug` are there when Wikidata has them, and `cover` when found.
- `subseries` are smaller series folded into this one.

## GET /api/games/{id}/series

The collection holding that title, or null.

## GET /api/games/{id}/next-in-series

`{"series": "Metro", "game": GameView}`, or null. The game is the first unplayed main-line entry after `{id}` in play order, else the series' own next pick. It's null when that game is on Play later already.
