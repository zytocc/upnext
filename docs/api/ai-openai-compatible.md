# Another provider: OpenAI-compatible servers

[API index](../API.md) · [AI backends](ai-backends.md) · [OpenAI API key](ai-openai-key.md)

`llm_backend` `openai` is any server that speaks `POST {base}/chat/completions`: Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, LocalAI, or a hosted OpenAI-compatible API. Settings calls it "Another provider". An `api.openai.com` address works here as "Other server", but the [OpenAI API key](ai-openai-key.md) backend is the one made for it.

- `openai_base_url` (`http://localhost:11434/v1`, Ollama), `openai_model` (required; the server's model id), `openai_api_key` (optional and write-only; `GET` gives `openai_api_key_set`), and `openai_digest_model`, a cheaper model on the same server for review summaries, which falls back to `openai_model`. Env `UPNEXT_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `UPNEXT_OPENAI_MODEL` and `UPNEXT_OPENAI_API_KEY`. The Claude model settings don't apply.
- From another device, a `PUT` that changes `openai_base_url` clears the saved key unless it sends a new one, so a token can't send the key to an address of its choosing. With the key in the environment, such a change is `403` unless it brings its own key.
- UpNext asks for JSON that fits a schema (`response_format: {type: "json_schema"}`). When the server answers `400` or `422` to that, it tries again with the schema adapted for strict servers such as OpenAI's own (no size or range limits, every object closed, every property required and the optional ones nullable, with the nulls that adds taken out of the reply), and when that is refused too, with `{type: "json_object"}` and the schema in the system prompt, and it accepts replies wrapped in code fences. An error from the server shows its API error message (`error.message`), never the page it answered with.
- `openai_thinking` (`UPNEXT_OPENAI_THINKING`): `auto` (the default), `off` or `on`. With `off`, each request carries `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}`, which vLLM and llama.cpp pass to the model's chat template, so a model that reasons before it answers (Qwen) answers at once. `on` sends nothing and leaves the model's default. `auto` is `off` for a server on this computer or network (loopback, private, tailnet and link-local addresses, or a name with no dot or ending `.lan`, `.local`, `.home`, `.internal`, `.home.arpa` or `.ts.net`) and `on` elsewhere, since a hosted API may refuse a field it doesn't know.

## GET /api/llm/models

`{"ok": true, "models": ["..."]}` from the server's `GET {base}/models`, or `{"ok": false, "models": [], "error": "..."}`. Settings uses it to suggest model ids.

## Prices

Calls to `api.openai.com` are priced and charged at OpenAI's list prices, and calls to `openrouter.ai` at OpenRouter's. Any other server has no price figure ([Prices](ai-prices.md)).
