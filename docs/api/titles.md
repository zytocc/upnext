# Titles and copies

A game owned on several stores is one `GameView`, a title. Each store's copy is listed under `copies`:

```json
{
  "id": 512, "name": "A Short Hike", "appid": 1055540, "steam_matched": true,
  "owned_on": ["gog", "epic"], "primary_source": "gog", "editions": [],
  "copies": [
    {"game_id": 646, "source": "gog", "source_id": "1901367087", "launcher": "heroic", "installed": true,
     "name": "A Short Hike", "edition": null,
     "playtime_minutes": 0, "playtime_known": false, "last_played": 0,
     "run_url": "heroic://launch/gog/1901367087", "store_url": "https://www.gog.com/..."},
    {"game_id": 5, "source": "epic", "source_id": "d640...", "launcher": "heroic", "installed": false, "...": "..."}
  ],
  "source": "gog", "source_id": "1901367087", "launcher": "heroic", "run_url": "heroic://launch/gog/1901367087", "...": "..."
}
```

- `id` is the title id, and stays the same. `copies[].game_id` is the store's own row.
- `owned_on` lists the stores in the order UpNext prefers to launch from. `primary_source` and the flat `source`, `source_id`, `launcher`, `run_url` and `store_url` describe the preferred copy: installed first, then Steam, GOG, Epic and Amazon.
- `installed` is true when any copy is installed. `playtime_minutes` is the most any copy that tracks it reports.
- Statuses, picks and HowLongToBeat belong to the title, so `exclude_ids` and a pick's `id` are title ids.

## Editions

Each copy carries the store's own `name` and an `edition` (`"Remastered"`, `"Game of the Year Edition"`… or null for the plain release). `GameView.editions` lists the distinct editions. Editions of one game group into one title, and the title's `name` is the plain release's when there is one:

```json
{"id": 9, "name": "Alan Wake", "editions": ["Remastered"],
 "copies": [
   {"game_id": 1300, "source": "steam", "name": "Alan Wake", "edition": null, "...": "..."},
   {"game_id": 13, "source": "epic", "name": "Alan Wake Remastered", "edition": "Remastered", "...": "..."}
 ]}
```

## Merging and splitting by hand

Both last through later syncs and regrouping. To find a title to merge with, search with `GET /api/games?q=...&limit=10`.

### POST /api/titles/merge

`{"ids": [9, 412]}`: two or more title ids, the first being the one that stays. Answers with the merged `GameView`.

The title that stays keeps its own name, Steam appid, status, note, ending switch and Play later. Another title's status, note or switch is taken only where it has none. Ratings, reasons, favourites and the like follow the same rule or move across.

`400` for fewer than two ids or an id named twice. `404`, with nothing merged, for a title the player doesn't see or one that isn't there.

### POST /api/titles/{id}/split

`{"game_id": 13}`, a `copies[].game_id` of that title. Answers `{"title": GameView, "detached": GameView}`.

The detached copy's new title gets back what it had before a merge folded it in. The title it leaves keeps its own. `400` when the title has a single copy; `404` when the copy isn't part of it.
