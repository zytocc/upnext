## environment

- `mode`: `app` (the desktop app), `service` (the systemd unit sets `UPNEXT_MODE=service`) or `serve`. `container` is true in the container image.
- `flatpak` is the Flatpak's app id (`io.github.zytocc.UpNext`) inside one, else null, so the wizard can say how to let the sandbox read a library elsewhere and how to install Claude Code inside it.
- `display`: the server's computer has a screen to open a window on (never in a container), checked rather than read from the variables. It's always true inside `upnext app`. On Linux it's a Wayland or X socket that takes a connection, or a `wayland-N` socket in the server's own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, which a service started before the desktop finds this way; a display with a host, as from `ssh -X`, counts. On Windows it's false for a service account and for `UPNEXT_MODE=service` without `SESSIONNAME`. On macOS it's true. `gog_window` says whether the [GOG sign-in window](gog.md#the-sign-in-window) can open.
- `client_local`: the browser is on the server's computer, so paths and windows mean something to the reader.

## stores

- `libraries` is [`GET /api/sync/sources`](sources.md).
- `steam` and `heroic` give the folder found or set, else `missing` (`not found`, or `not mounted` in a container), and `error` when it was found but couldn't be read. Heroic's `games` counts each store's cache.
- Steam's `account` is the SteamID in use or read from the client, with `account_source`, and `web_api` says whether the key and SteamID are both set. `local_games` is what the client's caches list for that account before any sync: only the games it played or installed when it isn't the account signed in to Steam last ([Steam](steam.md#what-a-sync-reads)).
- `steam.local_accounts` lists every account signed in to this computer's Steam client, most recent first, with `persona` and `player` (whose Steam connection has it, or null). Another player's account shows only `player`. For the first player, `account` is the client's most recent account; for anyone else it's their own SteamID, else the first local account nobody has, which their setup offers them ("That's me").
- `heroic.owner` is the player whose Heroic connection reads the folder shown. Heroic has one sign-in per user of the computer, so another player's Heroic is a folder of their own (`heroic_dir`); one with none is shown the first player's, so their setup can say whose it is.
- `other_users` lists the folders found in other users' home folders on this computer, for a request from this computer and never in a container: Steam's when this computer's own isn't found (`UPNEXT_STEAM_DIR` then names the one to read), and Heroic's that no player reads yet. Their setup offers each ("That's mine"), checking only that the files are there.

## The rest

- `keys`: whether each is set. The values never appear.
- `ai`: the chosen backend and whether it can run, with no call. `claude` is where the Claude CLI was found, or null. `claude_install` is a container's install of Claude Code (`UPNEXT_INSTALL_CLAUDE=1`): `{"installing": true, "error": null}` while it runs, `{"installing": false, "error": "…"}` when it failed, and null otherwise. `claude_token` says whether `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set for the server, never its value.
- `library`: the counts, `details_minutes` (an estimate for the titles without details, 3.05 seconds each), the last sync and the running job.
- `setup` is [`GET /api/setup/state`](setup.md#get-apisetupstate), and `background` is what [`POST /api/setup/background`](setup-background.md) answers.
- `you` is the request's player, for "Who plays here?". `placeholder` is true while their name is one UpNext made up ("Player 1", "Player N"). `suggested` is then a name to offer: the Steam account's `persona`, else the first player's Steam profile name, else (from this computer only, never in a container) the user name UpNext runs under, with a capital, but not root, a service account or a shared login such as `deck`, `steam`, `user` or `admin`. It's null when they have a name of their own, nothing fits, or another player has it. A player's name is never sent to the AI, the verdicts service or anywhere else.
