With an API key, the key owner's terms and usage policy apply. UpNext runs the CLIs you installed and signed in to, and never reads, stores or forwards their credentials (it checks only whether `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set). It offers no Claude login and pays for and resells nothing. OpenAI recommends API keys for automated workflows and has opened its plans to third-party tools with "Sign in with ChatGPT"; nothing was found against running your own signed-in Codex CLI.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub documents running the Copilot CLI from scripts ("programmatic" use, with `--output-format json`), and the CLI's licence (its `LICENSE.md`) lets an application ship unmodified copies of it. UpNext doesn't ship it: it runs the `copilot` you installed and signed in to, as a subprocess. Every call counts against your plan's allowance like any other Copilot request.

Individual plans fall under section J of GitHub's Terms of Service (AI features), and Copilot Business and Enterprise follow the organization's agreement, which can turn the CLI off.

## Claude Code

Anthropic's Claude Code legal page says:

- Subscription sign-in "is intended exclusively for purchasers of Claude Free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscription plans and is designed to support ordinary use of Claude Code and other native Anthropic applications."
- "Developers building products or services that interact with Claude's capabilities, including those using the Agent SDK, should use API key authentication."
- "Anthropic does not permit third-party developers to offer Claude.ai login into their own applications, or to route requests through Free, Pro, or Max plan credentials on behalf of their users", and developers "may not collect, store, or intermediate Claude.ai credentials or session tokens".
- None of that prevents "an end user from signing in to the unmodified Claude Code binary with their own Claude subscription".
- "Advertised usage limits for Pro and Max plans assume ordinary, individual usage of Claude Code and the Agent SDK."

UpNext runs the `claude` binary you installed and signed in to through Anthropic's own flow, unmodified, as a subprocess with `-p`, the pattern the Agent SDK docs describe for other languages. That's the end-user case the page allows. Anthropic's help article says `claude -p` and third-party app usage "still draw from your subscription's usage limits". The feature isn't called "Claude Code" in the app, and no Anthropic logos are used.

### In UpNext's container

Claude Code's licence (its `LICENSE.md`) is "© Anthropic PBC. All rights reserved. Use is subject to Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service". Nothing grants the right to pass the binary on, so UpNext's published image doesn't carry it.

A container installs it only when you ask (`UPNEXT_INSTALL_CLAUDE=1`, or `upnext install-claude`). It downloads the unmodified binary from Anthropic's own release site, checks it against Anthropic's manifest, and runs the binary's own `claude install`, as Anthropic's `install.sh` does, so the copy comes from Anthropic to you.

You sign it in with `claude setup-token`, Anthropic's flow for machines without a browser, and pass the token to your own container as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which the CLI inherits.
