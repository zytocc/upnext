# steamcmd has saved already (contrib/steam/README.md says how). STEAMCMD is the
# steamcmd to run (`steamcmd` by default). With --dry-run it fills in the
# build files, checks them and both depots, and says what it would run,
# without steamcmd or any network.
#
# Run it on Linux: SteamPipe keeps the files' executable bits from the
# system steamcmd runs on, and the Linux depot's launcher and programs need
# theirs.
